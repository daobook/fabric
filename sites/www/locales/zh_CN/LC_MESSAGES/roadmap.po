"**2.0**: Initial public release, arguably a technology preview and a "
"packaging/upgrade trial. Intent is to act as a jolt for users of 1.x who "
"aren't pinning their dependencies (sorry, folks!), enable installation "
"via PyPI so users don't have to install via Git to start upgrading, and "
"generally get everything above-board and iterating in classic semantic "
"versioning fashion."

"**2.1, 2.2, 2.3, etc**: Implement the most pressing \"missing features\","
" including features which were present in 1.0 (see :ref:`upgrading` for "
"details on these) as well as any brand new features we've been wanting in"
" 2.x for a while (though most of these will come via Invoke and/or "
"Paramiko releases -- see note below for more)."

#: ../../roadmap.rst:33
msgid ""
"**3.0, 4.0, etc**: Subsequent major releases will **not** be full-on "
"rewrites as 2.0 was, but will be *small* (feature-release-sized) releases"
" that just happen to contain one or more backwards incompatible API "
"changes. These will be clearly marked in the changelog and reflected in "
"the upgrading documentation."

#: ../../roadmap.rst:40

"Many features that you may use via Fabric will only need development in "
"the libraries Fabric wraps -- `Invoke <https://pyinvoke.org>`_ and "
"`Paramiko <https://paramiko.org>`_ -- and unless Fabric itself needs "
"changes to match, you can often get new features by upgrading only one of"
" the three. Make sure to check the other projects' changelogs "
"periodically!"

"Fabric 1.x has reached a tipping point regarding internal tech debt, lack"
" of testability & ability to make improvements without harming backwards "
"compatibility. As such, the 1.x line now receives bugfixes only. We "
"**strongly** encourage all users to :ref:`upgrade <upgrading>` to Fabric "
"2.x."
