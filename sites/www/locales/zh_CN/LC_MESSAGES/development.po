"**Use Fabric and send us feedback!** This is both the easiest and "

" you currently use Fabric and how you want to use it. (Please do try to "
"search the `ticket tracker`_ first, though, when submitting feature "
"ideas.)"

"Recent minor release branches typically continue to receive critical "
"bugfixes, often extending back two or three release lines (so e.g. if 2.4"
" was the currently active release line, 2.3 and perhaps even 2.2 might "
"get patches)."

"Depending on the nature of bugs found and the difficulty in backporting "
"them, older release lines may also continue to get bugfixes -- but "
"there's no guarantee of any kind. Thus, if a bug were found in 2.4 that "
"affected 2.1 and could be easily applied, a new 2.1.x version *might* be "
"released."
